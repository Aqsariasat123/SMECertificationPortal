# Brand Voice & UX Writing Guide
## SME Certification Portal - Phase 1

---

## Purpose

This guide exists to ensure **long-term consistency** as the platform scales. It is a **reference**, not a design constraint.

As we continue building out the platform, this document serves as a shared reference going forward. It is not meant to introduce new scope or changes to what's already approved — simply a baseline to help keep copy, labels, CTAs, and visual cues consistent as new screens and flows are added.

---

## Core Principles

The core idea is straightforward:

- **The platform should read like a certification authority**, not a marketplace or startup.
- **Language should stay certification-first**, registry-focused, and action-led.
- **Visual and copy choices should reinforce trust**, clarity, and institutional credibility.

> Please treat this guide as a reference point when working on future UI, copy, and UX decisions. If anything ever feels unclear or conflicting, align with the team quickly.

## Core Positioning
**Certification-first platform** - NOT a marketplace, NOT a fundraising platform.
