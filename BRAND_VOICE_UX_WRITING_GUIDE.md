# Brand Voice & UX Writing Guide
## SME Certification Portal - Phase 1

---

## Purpose

This guide exists to ensure **long-term consistency** as the platform scales. It is a **reference**, not a design constraint.

As we continue building out the platform, this document serves as a shared reference going forward. It is not meant to introduce new scope or changes to what's already approved — simply a baseline to help keep copy, labels, CTAs, and visual cues consistent as new screens and flows are added.

---

## Core Principles

The core idea is straightforward:

- **The platform should read like a certification authority**, not a marketplace or startup.
- **Language should stay certification-first**, registry-focused, and action-led.
- **Visual and copy choices should reinforce trust**, clarity, and institutional credibility.

> Please treat this guide as a reference point when working on future UI, copy, and UX decisions. If anything ever feels unclear or conflicting, align with the team quickly.

## Core Positioning
**Certification-first platform** - NOT a marketplace, NOT a fundraising platform.

## Account Type Selection (Intent vs Identity)

### Key Principle
The entry point should be **action-led (intent-based)**, not **identity-led**.

**AVOID identity-based framing:**
- "I am a SME"
- "I am an Investor"
- "Register as..."

**USE intent-based framing:**
- "Certify a Business"
- "Browse Certified Businesses"

### Option A – SME Path
| Element | Correct Copy |
|---------|--------------|
| Heading | Certify a Business |
| Subtext | Get certified to access the official registry and new opportunities. |
| Button | Start Certification |
| Icon | Shield / Checkmark icon |

### Option B – Browser/Partner Path
| Element | Correct Copy |
|---------|--------------|
| Heading | Browse Certified Businesses |
| Subtext | Access the registry of verified SMEs. |
| Micro-copy | View-only access *(clarifies read-only in Phase 1)* |
| Button | Access Registry |
| Icon | Search / List icon |

---

## Icon Guidelines

| Action/Context | Icon Type |
|----------------|-----------|
| Certification (SME Path) | Shield / Checkmark |
| Browse Registry | Search / List |

---

## Stepper Labels

### Key Principle
- Avoid showing same label twice (e.g., "Details" twice)
- Consider renaming for clarity (e.g., "Review" or "Confirmation" for final step)

### SME Path (3 Steps)
1. **Type** - Account type selection
2. **Company** - Company information
3. **Personal** - Personal details / credentials

### Browser Path (2 Steps)
1. **Type** - Account type selection
2. **Account** - Personal details / credentials

### Step Progression
The flow should follow: **Intent → Company → User**
- Clear step progression
- Consistent with institutional, certification-first tone

---

## Landing Page

### How It Works Section
| Step | Heading | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Start Certification | Begin your certification process and submit your business details. |
| 2 | Submit Documents | Upload your trade license, financial statements, and required documents. |
| 3 | Get Certified | Our team reviews and issues your certification within 24-48 hours. |

**Important:** Step 1 must emphasize certification process, NOT "company registration" or "register your company".

### Registry Emphasis
The hero subtext's reference to the **official UAE SME registry** works well and should remain a **central theme** as it is a core value proposition.

---

## CTA Hierarchy

### Primary CTAs (Green Button)
- Start Certification
- Complete Setup
- Access Certification Portal

### Secondary CTAs (Outlined Button)
- Sign In
- Access Registry

### Key Rules
- Limit each section to **one clear primary CTA** to avoid clutter or marketplace signaling
- All CTAs must remain **action-led**, not identity-based

---

## Color Usage Rules

| Element | Color | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Primary CTAs | Green (teal-600) | e.g., "Start Certification", "Access Registry" |
| Secondary CTAs | Outlined (teal border) or neutral | |
| Structural Elements | Dark/black tones | For layout, headers, panels only — NOT for primary actions |
| Text | Graphite tones | |

### Important
- Avoid introducing additional accent colors at this stage
- Keep the system **institutional and cohesive**
- Green is for primary actions only

---

## Layout Hierarchy (Landing Page)

Apply consistently across public-facing screens:

1. **Hero** (single CTA)
2. **Proof / Credibility** (stats)
3. **Value Proposition** (features)
4. **How It Works** (steps)
5. **Primary CTA** (single CTA)

### Layout Principles
- Maintain clear section hierarchy
- Limit each section to one clear primary CTA
- Keep the visual tone **clean and restrained** (certification-grade rather than promotional)

---

## Auth Layout

### Split-Screen Auth Layouts
- **Use:** Neutral, contextual imagery (business / documentation / collaboration)
- **Avoid:** Aspirational or lifestyle visuals

---

## Global Content Rules

### Certification-First Language
Ensure language remains strictly focused on:
- Certification
- Readiness
- Registry access

### Avoid (Phase 1)
- Fundraising
- Investing
- Pledging
- Deal-making

### Use
- Certification
- Verification
- Credibility
- Registry access

> We want to avoid implying that this is a fundraising platform in Phase 1. Investor-specific onboarding flows can be introduced in a later phase once the core certification utility is validated.

---

## System Emails (Phase 1)

The following automated system emails should follow the same institutional, certification-first tone:

| Email Type | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Welcome / Account Created | Confirmation of account setup |
| Application Submitted | Confirmation of certification application |
| Verification In Progress | Status update during review |
| Certification Issued | Success notification |
| Revisions or Additional Information Required | Request for additional documents |

*Copy for these emails should be reviewed and aligned to ensure consistency across the full user journey.*

---

```
